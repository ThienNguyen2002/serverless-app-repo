## About Me
My name is Thien Nguyen. I just finished my second year at the University of Utah under the School of Computing. I am currently studying Computer Science. Right now I am not taking any summer classes, and this is a great opportunity for me to learn and build what I want. Here is what I'm doing for this summer (some of these can't be achieved by the end of this summer, but as a contuing education during school).
1. Build 'small' side projects. (currently building one under React Native and .NET). Still learning how React Native works, but it should be most of my other planned projects. Also want to build a small portfolio website with Three.JS.  
2. LeetCode, Pramp, for coding interviews. Also Read Cracking the Code Interview. 
3. Learn Full Stack Development under TheOdinProject
4. Learn JavaScript under TheBitProject
5. Start learning Vietnamese. 
Nice to meet you all!
